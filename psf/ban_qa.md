Some brief notes addressing questions in replies to [Ethan's followup post](https://discuss.python.org/t/shedding-light-on-a-three-month-suspension/66337):

- As of Aug 8, the day after the ban, the SC represented to me that I had already agreed to do everything they asked for the ban to be lifted on the expiration day. It's not lifting of the ban I'm aiming at, it's transparency.

- However, Aug 8 is also the last time I heard from the SC. They haven't replied to anything ij sent to them since. I'm apparently
ghosted for the duration.

- Which is why I didn't ask for permission. I don't get a reply to anything anymore, and I will not publish their email without their explicit permission.

- But all of that happened after the ban, so was out of scope for my pre-ban blog.

- I still intend to return. I can't say whether the SC has changed their collective mind.
