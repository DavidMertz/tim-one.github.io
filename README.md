Scope

This is about my (Tim Peters) 3-month [ban](https://discuss.python.org/t/three-month-suspension-for-a-core-developer/60250) from CPython core development, announced 7-Aug-2024. The intent is to eliminate the "information asymmetry" that usually accompanies a ban, by disclosing my interactions with PSF reprresentatives in full. I've always advocated for transparency in all matters. I didn't want an "anonymous" ban to begin with, and want no secrets (aka "privacy") during the ban either.
